description: "Retrieves the execution data of all open cases of a process. It returns counters for each flow node in the process, showing the number of flow node instances that are in an non-final state (possible states are: ready, executing, waiting, initializing, failed, completing). If there are no flow node instances in a given state, no counter is returned for that state for the flow node."
