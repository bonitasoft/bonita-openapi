    Delete Process for the given list of ID.

    **Warning: Beware! Data loss risk!**

    Deleting a process will automatically delete all its process instances (on-going and archived alike).
    Thus, the operation may take a long time, and fail if the transaction timeout is not large enough. This feature should only be used on non-production environments.

    **Please proceed at your own risk.**
