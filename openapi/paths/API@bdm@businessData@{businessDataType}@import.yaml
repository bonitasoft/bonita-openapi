  summary: Import Business Data by bulk
  description: |

    ![edition](https://img.shields.io/badge/edition-entreprise-blue)
    
    Allows to import business data in bulk by uploading a file containing the data, in CSV format.
    
    Example CSV file content:
    ```csv
    firstName,lastName,department, dptReference, dateOfBirth, dateOfBirthWithTime, meetingDateAndTimeWithTimezone, otherDateAndTimeWithTimezone
    "John","Doe","Engineering", 14, "1907-05-26", "1907-05-26T01:59:42", "2025-11-29T10:15:00+01:00", "2025-11-29T10:15:00Z"
    "Jane","Smith", "Marketing", 17, "1977-03-24", "1977-03-24T17:40:00", "2025-07-19T09:00:00+01:00", "2025-07-19T09:00:00Z"
    ```
    
    Field separator can be comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`). Space characters around the separator will be ignored (trimmed).
    
    The first line of the CSV file is considered as the header, and must contain the field names, with the exact same upper/lower case.
    
    String fields must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`), numeric / boolean fields must not. Date fields must be strings in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2023-10-01T12:00:00Z`).
