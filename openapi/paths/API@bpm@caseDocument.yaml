    Finds ProcessInstanceDocuments with pagination params and filters

    It is possible to filter on three parameters: `submittedBy`, `name` and `description`.

     * `submittedBy="id"`: search for documents that were submitted by the user with the specified identifier.
     * `name="string"`: search for documents with names that contain _string_.
       Depending on the setting for [word-based search](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/latest/api/using-list-and-search-methods#word_based_search), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the name or the start of a word in the name.
     * `description="string"`: search for documents with descriptions that contain _string_.
       Depending on the setting for [word-based search](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/latest/api/using-list-and-search-methods#word_based_search), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the description or the start of a word in the description.

    Create the ProcessInstanceDocument.

    Use a POST method to add a document to a process instances. You can upload a document from the local file system or by URL.
    Specify the process instance id and the document name in the payload. The document description is optional: if you do not specify a description, the description in the response is empty.
    The response contains a version, which is managed automatically. You cannot currently retrieve a specific version of a document, only the most recent version.
    To retrieve earlier versions of a ProcessInstanceDocument, use the archivedProcessInstanceDocument resource.
