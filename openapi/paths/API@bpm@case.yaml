    Create the ProcessInstance
    This way of creating a process instance using this method will only work for processes in which no contract is defined. To instantiate a process with a contract, check the process instantiation resource documentation.
  operationId: createProcessInstance
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '../components/schemas/ProcessInstanceCreateRequest.yaml'
    description: |
      **Warning**: The attribute `variables` on the request payload is used to initialize the process variables (not BDM variables). If you want to initialize BDM variables at process instantiation, add a contract on the process and map BDM variables to the contract data. See Start a process using an instantiation contract for usage.
