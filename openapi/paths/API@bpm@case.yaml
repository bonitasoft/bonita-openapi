    Finds ProcessInstances with pagination params and filters

    You can filter on:

    * `processDefinitionId`: The process definition ID
    * `rootCaseId`: the root process instance ID (since version 10.3 - 2025.1)
    * `name`: the process name
    * `started_by`: the ID of the user who started the process
    * `team_manager_id`: allow to retrieve the process instances in which all users with this manager ID ar involved)
    * `supervisor_id`: allow the retrived the process instances of all processes the user with this ID is supervisor of) beware you cannot use team_manager_id and supervisor_id at the same time
    * `searchIndex1Value`, `searchIndex2Value`, `searchIndex3Value`, `searchIndex4Value`, `searchIndex5Value`: the value of the corresponding search index (since version 10.3 - 2025.1)

    Create the ProcessInstance
    This way of creating a process instance using this method will only work for processes in which no contract is defined. To instantiate a process with a contract, check the process instantiation resource documentation.
  operationId: createProcessInstance
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '../components/schemas/ProcessInstanceCreateRequest.yaml'
    description: |
      **Warning**: The attribute `variables` on the request payload is used to initialize the process variables (not BDM variables). If you want to initialize BDM variables at process instantiation, add a contract on the process and map BDM variables to the contract data. See Start a process using an instantiation contract for usage.
