    Create the Case
    This way of creating a case using this method will only work for processes in which no contract is defined. To instantiate a process with a contract, check the process instantiation resource documentation.

      **Warning**: The attribute `variables` on the request payload is used to initialize the process variables (not BDM variables). If you want to initialize BDM variables at process instantiation, add a contract on the process and map BDM variables to the contract data. See Start a process using an instantiation contract for usage.
