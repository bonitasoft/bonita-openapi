  summary: Finds the CaseDocument by ID
  description: |
    Returns the single CaseDocument for the given ID.
    Use a GET method to get a document from a case. First you get the document information, then you download the content. To get the document information, specify the document id in the URL. The document id is created when you upload a document to a case. There is no payload.
  operationId: getCaseDocumentById
  parameters:
    - description: ID of the CaseDocument to return
      in: path
      name: documentId
      required: true
      schema:
        format: int64
        type: integer
  responses:
    '200':
      description: |
        successful operation.
        The response includes the "url" to use to download the content. Call the documentDownload servlet with this URL: /portal/documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4. Note: Since Bonita 7.10, document url fileName is now URL encoded. This will avoid errors when a document to be downloaded contains special characters in its name.
        In the previous versions, a workaround was necessary client-side using the javascript native function "encodeURI" to generate document download url. You can now remove this workaround.

  summary: Update the CaseDocument by ID

    Update the CaseDocument for the given ID

    You update a document in a case by uploading a new version of the document using a PUT method. You can upload a document version from the local file system or by URL. The document name will be used in all the cases of the process, but the combination of case id and document name is unique.
    In the URL, you specify to supply the document id. This is included in the response when you first add a document to a case.
    The response to PUT methods is the same as for POST methods.
