This project is about describing the Bonita web API in https://swagger.io/specification/[Open API v3] format.

This single yaml file is to become the single source of truth for the Bonita features accessible through HTTP.

Based on this file, one could generate : documentation, client in different language and/or technology, server side stubs, ...

== Open API v3

The specification file is written in `yaml` format because multiline support is much better than in `json`
The specification has a lot of _description block_ and since it is a _documentation_, it needs to be quite verbose.

The specification file can be found here: `openapi/openapi.yaml`

We make use of https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/[extensions] to add better support for some documentation sites (x-logo, x-codeSamples, ...)

This repository structure was inspired by https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo.

== Live Documentation

The api descriptor file can be used to render documentation sites. Those sites have different rendering and may show different parts of the specification file.
That's the reason why it is interesting to test and evaluate different sites and rendering.

You 'll need to install the https://github.com/redocly/openapi-cli[openapi-cli] to be able to work on the specification.

=== Redoc Preview

A https://github.com/Redocly/redoc[ReDoc] site is available at http://localhost:8080 when you run from project directory

[source,bash]
----
npm start
----

This preview is the preferred one when editing the specification.

=== Swagger Preview

The `docker-compose.yaml` file at the project root starts two sites: a https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[swagger-ui] site and a Bonita instance to query

To start the container, just issue the following comment at the project root:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

You should be able to access:

- Bonita: http://bonita.localhost/bonita
- Swagger UI: http://swagger.localhost

NOTE: You can keep on editing the specification file and just refresh the browser to see the changes.

== Create a release

A GitHub action is used to automate the link:.github/workflows/release.yml[release workflow].
The workflow is triggered when pushing a branch with the following pattern `release/<version>`.
The `version` should match the `info.version` attribute in link:openapi/openapi.yaml[] file.

A GitHub release is created with the `yaml` specification file and the `json` postman collection attached.
Release note must be filled manually.
